# Embellisher
A CSS and JavaScript framework to put bells and whistles to your site or app.

## JavaScript
The Javascript resembles the functionality that jQuery offers, including the method chaining. This makes it very simple to create and edit your elements.

```javascript
emb('form[embellished]').addClass('someClass').children('input').val('some value');
```
This finds all the form elements that have the `embellished` attribute and adds the `someClass` CSS class to it. Then it gets the child input elements and sets the value to `some value`;

Using this we can easily perform failry complex amounts of changes to a page without a lot of code and annoying for-loops. I've taken care of that for you ;)
